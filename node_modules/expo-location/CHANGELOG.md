### 🐛 Bug fixes

- Added some safety checks to prevent `NullPointerExceptions` in background location on Android. ([#8864](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8864) by [@mczernek](https://github.com/mczernek))
- Add `isoCountryCode` to `Address` type and reverse lookup. ([#8913](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/8913) by [@bycedric](https://github.com/bycedric))
- Fix geocoding requests not resolving/rejecting on iOS when the app is in the background or inactive state. It makes it possible to use geocoding in such app states, however it's still discouraged. ([#9178](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/9178) by [@tsapeta](https://github.com/tsapeta))
